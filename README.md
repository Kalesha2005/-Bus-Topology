🖧 Bus Topology in Cisco Packet Tracer
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Bus Topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
A bus topology is a network setup where each computer and network device is connected to a single backbone or communication line.

In this simulation:

Multiple PCs are connected through switches aligned in a linear fashion.

Data packets travel across the main backbone until they reach their destination.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Cisco Packet Tracer (Network Simulation Tool)

Switches (2960-24TT)

End Devices (PCs)

Straight-Through Cables

📂 Project File

The Packet Tracer file (.pkt) is included in this repository:

BUS_TOPOLOGY_EX_1.pkt

⚙️ Network Setup

4 PCs connected via switches

Linear bus structure

Communication tested using ICMP (Ping messages)

📸 Topology Diagram

✅ Simulation Results

PCs successfully communicate with each other using Ping.

Data travels along the bus until it reaches the intended device.

🚀 How to Run

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Load the provided .pkt file.

Start the simulation in Realtime/Simulation Mode.

Test communication between PCs using the ping command.

📖 Learning Outcomes

Understanding the Bus Topology concept.

Familiarity with switches and cabling in Packet Tracer.

Hands-on practice with network simulation and testing.
